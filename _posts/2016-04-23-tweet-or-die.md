The 2016 U.S. presidential race has been crazy. Twitter, due to its immediacy and openness, can provide unique insights into real-time changes in public opinion.

While the analysis is subject to change depending on the batch of tweets collected, one predominant theme persists throughout: Twitter loves Donald Trump.

In terms of both tweet volume and sentiment, Trump dominates all other candidates. Based on a random sample of a million tweets from __ to __, Trump tweets make up an average of __% of all tweets, __% of which are positive (for comparison, just __% of all other candidates' tweets are positive, on average).

The practical significance of these findings remains to be seen. As Michelle Obama recently [pointed out](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/23/politics/michelle-obama-commencement-speech/): "_You can hashtag all over Instagram and Twitter, but those social media movements will disappear faster than a Snapchat if you're not also registered to vote,_". In contrast, a recent election in Mexico suggests Twitter can have a substantial effect on electoral outcomes, to the point where politicians are incentivized to artificially boost their social media presence with bots. Indeed, recent analyses by [FiveThirtyEight]() and [__]() find anywhere from __% to __% of the current U.S. presidential candidates' Twitter followers to be fake accounts, with Trump having the highest percentage of fake followers.

Predictive power aside, certainly the most entertaining application of the tool is watching Twitter react throughout highly publicized events, such as debates or primary elections. The imagination of negative tweeters is particularly amusing:
