TL;DR: Watch Twitter react to the candidates in real-time with this [RShiny application](http://52.38.152.177:3838/Campaign/).

The immediacy and unfiltered nature of tweets can provide unique insights into real-time changes in public opinion. This tool captures streaming tweets about each of the 2016 U.S. presidential candidates and calculates the sentiment of those tweets.

The analysis is subject to change depending on the batch of tweets collected. Nonetheless, the following findings seem to hold true the majority of the time:

* People tweet about Donald Trump far more than any other candidate, and they love him
* Tweets about Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz are predominantly negative

The electoral importance of these findings remains to be seen. As Michelle Obama recently [pointed out](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/23/politics/michelle-obama-commencement-speech/):
> "You can hashtag all over Instagram and Twitter, but those social media movements will disappear faster than a Snapchat if you're not also registered to vote,"
