TL;DR: Watch Twitter react to the candidates in real-time with this [RShiny application](http://52.38.152.177:3838/Campaign/).

The immediacy and unfiltered nature of tweets can provide unique insights into real-time changes in public opinion. This tool calculates the sentiment of streaming tweets about each of the 2016 U.S. presidential candidates.

Although the analysis is subject to change depending on the batch of tweets collected, one thing seems to hold true: people tweet about Donald Trump far more than any other candidate, and they love him.

The electoral importance of these findings remains to be seen. As Michelle Obama recently [pointed out](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/23/politics/michelle-obama-commencement-speech/): "_You can hashtag all over Instagram and Twitter, but those social media movements will disappear faster than a Snapchat if you're not also registered to vote,_".
