Currently an <strong>Analytics Specialist</strong> at a tech startup called <a href="http://videoblocks.com" target="_blank">VideoBlocks</a>, I create models of online customer behavior and manage our A/B testing infrastructure. I previously worked as a <strong>Senior Data Analyst</strong> for <a href="http://www.boozallen.com/" target="_blank">Booz Allen Hamilton</a>, where I developed immigration forecasts for the Department of Homeland Security. I also built several <strong>RShiny</strong> applications for various clients to visualize trends in global disease detection, explore NFL play calling, and cluster MLB pitchers. After grad school, I worked as a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> in the Macroeconomics Department of <a href="https://www.grupbancsabadell.com/en/" target="_blank">Banc Sabadell</a> in Spain, measuring price bubbles in the Colombian housing market.

I have an <strong>MS in International Trade, Finance, and Development</strong> from the <a href="http://www.barcelonagse.eu/" target="_blank">Barcelona Graduate School of Economics</a> and a <strong>BS in Economics</strong> from <a href="https://www.gonzaga.edu/" target="_blank">Gonzaga University</a>. For my Master's thesis I drafted a policy proposal on primary education reform in Argentina, using cluster analysis to determine the optimal regions to implement the program. I also conducted research in behavioral economics and experimental design, using original surveys and statistical modelling to estimate framing effects and the maximization of employee effort.

I am passionate about using data and statistical models to answer unique research questions. Using <strong>R</strong> and <strong>RShiny</strong>, I enjoy tapping into interesting datasets and creating interactive tools and visiualizations. I am also proficient in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>, and as an avid follower of the data science community, I am constantly tinkering with new languages and techniques to apply in my work.
