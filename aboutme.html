Obtained an MS in <strong>Specialized Economic Analysis</strong> from the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics and my BS in <strong>Economics</strong> from Gonzaga University. For my Master's thesis I drafted a policy proposal on <strong>primary education reform in Argentina</strong>, using cluster analysis to determine the optimal regions to implement the program. I also conducted research in <strong>behavioral economics and experimental design</strong>, using original surveys and statistical modelling to estimate framing effects and the maximization of employee effort.

I'm addicted to soccer, <strong>travelling</strong> at any given (and non-given) moment, getting into philosophical debates,
and meeting new people :)
