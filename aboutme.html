Currently an <strong>Analytics Specialist</strong> at a tech startup called <a href="http://videoblocks.com" target="_blank">VideoBlocks</a>, I spend my days creating <strong>predictive models of online customer behavior</strong> and managing our <strong>A/B testing</strong> infrastructure. I previously worked as a <strong>Senior Data Analyst</strong> in the <a href="http://www.boozallen.com/consulting/strategic-innovation" target="_blank">Strategic Innovation Group</a> at <a href="http://www.boozallen.com/" target="_blank">Booz Allen Hamilton</a>, where I developed <strong>immigration forecasts</strong> for the Department of Homeland Security. I also built several <strong>RShiny</strong> applications for various clients to visualize trends in <strong>global disease detection</strong>, explore <strong>NFL play calling</strong> by down and distance, and <strong>cluster MLB pitchers</strong> based on PITCHf/x data. After grad school, I worked as a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> in the Macroeconomics Department of <a href="https://www.grupbancsabadell.com/en/" target="_blank">Banc Sabadell</a> in Spain, using recursive stationarity testing to <strong>predict price bubbles</strong> in the Colombian housing market.

I have an MS in <strong>Specialized Economic Analysis</strong> from the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics and a BS in <strong>Economics</strong> from Gonzaga University. For my Master's thesis I drafted a policy proposal on <strong>primary education reform in Argentina</strong>, using cluster analysis to determine the optimal regions to implement the program. I also conducted research in <strong>behavioral economics</strong> and <strong>experimental design</strong>, using original surveys and statistical modelling to estimate framing effects and the maximization of employee effort.

I am passionate about using data and statistical models to answer unique research questions. Using <strong>R</strong> and <strong>RShiny</strong>, I enjoy tapping into interesting datasets and creating interactive tools and visiualizations. An avid follower of the data science community, I am constantly tinkering with new languages and techniques to apply in my work.

A Pacific Northwest native, I grew up in Everett, Washington. After studying abroad in Granada, Spain in college, I decided to go back to Spain for grad school and travelled around Europe while not studying.
